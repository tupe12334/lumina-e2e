# Hebrew RTL Onboarding Flow Testing Guide

This document explains how to run and validate the comprehensive Hebrew onboarding flow E2E tests that ensure all RTL (Right-to-Left) fixes are working correctly.

## Overview

The `hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts` test file provides comprehensive coverage of:

- **Language switching to Hebrew** - Validates proper language selection and document direction changes
- **RTL layout rendering** - Ensures all UI components are properly aligned for RTL languages
- **Hebrew text display** - Verifies all onboarding text is displayed in Hebrew
- **Form field functionality** - Tests form interactions in Hebrew/RTL mode
- **Step indicators and navigation** - Validates proper RTL navigation flow
- **Directional icons and elements** - Ensures arrows and directional UI elements flip correctly
- **Dropdown menus and selects** - Tests enhanced select components in Hebrew/RTL
- **Validation and error handling** - Verifies Hebrew error messages and validation
- **Complete user journeys** - End-to-end Hebrew onboarding flow completion
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Hebrew/RTL experience on mobile viewports

## Test Structure

### Test Organization
The tests are organized into logical describe blocks:

1. **Language Switching and RTL Foundation** - Core RTL setup and validation
2. **RTL Layout and Component Alignment** - UI layout and positioning tests  
3. **Hebrew Text Display and Content** - Text localization validation
4. **Form Functionality in Hebrew/RTL Mode** - Interactive form element tests
5. **Validation and Error Handling in Hebrew** - Error message and validation tests
6. **Directional Icons and Visual Elements** - Icon and visual element RTL tests
7. **Complete Hebrew Onboarding Flow** - End-to-end user journey tests
8. **Mobile Hebrew Onboarding Experience** - Mobile-specific RTL tests

### Key Test Areas

#### Language Context Setup
Each test uses a `setupHebrewContext()` helper function that:
- Navigates to the homepage
- Switches to Hebrew language 
- Verifies RTL document direction is applied
- Logs in and navigates to onboarding
- Returns page objects and context for testing

#### RTL Validation Patterns
Tests validate RTL behavior by checking:
- `document.documentElement.dir` equals 'rtl'
- `document.documentElement.lang` equals 'he' 
- CSS text alignment properties (right/start alignment)
- Element positioning and layout
- Dropdown positioning relative to triggers

#### Hebrew Content Validation
Tests verify Hebrew content by looking for:
- Specific Hebrew text patterns (e.g., "בחר מוסד לימוד", "סיום")
- Hebrew Unicode character ranges (`/[\u0590-\u05FF]/`)
- Known Hebrew/localized institution names
- Error messages containing Hebrew keywords

#### Visual Regression Testing
Tests capture screenshots at key points:
- Initial Hebrew RTL state
- Form layouts in RTL mode
- Dropdown positioning and content
- Error states and validation messages
- Complete onboarding flows

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. **Development environment** - Application must be running (`pnpm dev`)
2. **Backend services** - All microservices must be accessible
3. **Test data** - Universities and degrees must be available via APIs
4. **Hebrew translations** - Complete Hebrew translation files must be loaded

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all Hebrew onboarding tests
cd apps/e2e
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts

# Run specific test groups
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --grep "Language Switching"
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --grep "Form Functionality"

# Run with specific browser
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --project=chromium
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --project=firefox
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run in headed mode to see browser interactions
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --headed

# Run in debug mode with inspector
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --debug

# Generate and update screenshots
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Run in CI mode (suitable for automated environments)
CI=true pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts

# Generate reports
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts --reporter=html --reporter=json
```

# Full validation  
pnpm test:e2e hebrew-onboarding-flow.spec.ts
```

### RTL Development Checklist
When making RTL-related changes, ensure:
- [ ] Language switching maintains proper document direction
- [ ] All form elements align correctly for RTL
- [ ] Text content displays in Hebrew when language is switched
- [ ] Dropdown menus position correctly for RTL
- [ ] Icons and directional elements flip appropriately  
- [ ] Error messages and validation appear in Hebrew
- [ ] Mobile layouts adapt properly for RTL
- [ ] Complete user flows work end-to-end

### Continuous Monitoring
Set up automated testing to catch RTL regressions:
- Run Hebrew RTL tests on every PR involving UI changes
- Include Hebrew onboarding tests in nightly test suites
- Monitor screenshot diffs for unexpected RTL layout changes
- Validate Hebrew translation updates don't break functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Test Environment Issues
If tests fail due to environment setup:
1. Verify development server is running on correct port
2. Check all backend services are accessible
3. Ensure Hebrew translation files are loaded
4. Validate test data (universities/degrees) is available

### RTL-Specific Debugging  
For RTL-related test failures:
1. Check browser console for CSS direction errors
2. Inspect element styles for missing RTL properties
3. Verify Hebrew fonts are loading correctly
4. Test manually in browser with Hebrew language selected

### Screenshot Comparison Issues
For visual regression failures:
1. Update snapshots if RTL changes are intentional
2. Check for timing issues in dynamic content loading
3. Verify consistent browser rendering across environments
4. Review threshold settings for screenshot comparisons

## Contributing

When adding new RTL tests:
1. Follow the existing test structure and patterns
2. Use the `setupHebrewContext()` helper for consistency
3. Include both functional and visual validation
4. Add appropriate screenshot capture points
5. Document new test scenarios in this guide
6. Ensure tests work across different browsers and viewports
